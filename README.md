# Jack-s-Projects

Hello! Unfortunately, due to class requirements, and Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Northeastern University codes of academic integrity, I am not permitted to make my 
past projects and assignments publicly available for Object Oriented Design (CS3500) and Computer Science Fundamentals 1 & 2 (CS2500 and CS2510). For future employers, co-workers,
and others interested in my work thus far for reasons outside of using my work for their own personal assignments / advantage in their class, please email me at
craciun.j@northeastern.edu, and I would be more than willing yo share my work!
